A 42 school - Hive Helsinki - project. 

First exploration into graphics programming, and 3d modelling

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” representation of a relief landscape 
linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. 
The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program. 

The project displays 3 different perspectives, as well as rotation around each axis, the colour changes according
to the altitude of the map.

The project uses the miniLibX graphics library which can be found inside the repository. 

See some screenshots from the project below:
